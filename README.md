Abstract
--------

Genome scrambling in the Tree of Life.

We recently reported that the zooplankton Oikopleura dioica comprises multiple
cryptic species for which no morphological markers could be found, but that
dramatically differ in gene order. We showed that process of “scrambling” their
genomes is faster than in Ciona (another tunicate), Drosophila or
Caenorhabditis (invertebrates which have in common with Oikopleura a small
genome size and a short life cycle). Is Oikopleura doica's genome exceptional
in comparison to all other living beings? I am testing this hypothesis with a
pairwise genome comparison screen in clades distributed across the whole Tree
of Life. In this poster, I will report my preliminary results with a focus on
marine organisms.

Poster presentations on April 23–25 and flash talk on April 25.
